TDD and BASIC LIBRARIES
Haskell has a simple way to implement unit tests due to the type classes and monads.

Installed HUnit and HSpec by running cabal commands

cabal install HUnit
cabal install hspec


-- Notes
- I am feeling a bit lost with progress atm
- need to redo tutorials on Monads and applicatives
- or develop some software to test the functionality
- perhaps I should implment the MONOPOLY game, or a reduced LUDO version.
    -- think of a reduced set of rules that uses all the monad functionality.
