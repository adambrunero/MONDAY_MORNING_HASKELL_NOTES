--learning Haskell Notes

Monday Morning Haskell lecture 1
--everything in Haskell is an expression
-- to get the type of an element use :t

Types are used to determine expression compatibility through function composition

partial application is a allowed, have to used brackets to show that it is a function.

>>let f = (5 +)
>>f 4

- lists in haskell all have to be the same type
- a string is just a list of Characters

Tuples are used to combine elements of different type
 we can combine multiple data types into the tuple
 also, we can make lists of tuples provided that they are all of the same type!

- up to section 2 if else statements.

If and Else statements
- return values have to be of the same type

- there is no elif like python, however you can use nested if statements.

If Statements can be rewritted with GUARDS


--up to pattern matching, I have written the function but not worked through the example.
